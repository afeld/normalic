= Normalic

Easy U.S address parser

== More info

Don't you wanna punch yourself in the face every time you have to normalize U.S mailing addresses?

I did repeatedly while writing this gem so you don't have to anymore.

It tries to correct mal-formed address to the best of its ability.

== Example

address = Normalic::Address.parse("201 Varick St. floor 12th, New York, NY 10014")
